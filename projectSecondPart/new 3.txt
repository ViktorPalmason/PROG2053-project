	 This should be the UserPhotos view of the PhotoShare app. Since
      it is invoked from React Router the params from the route will be
      in property match. So this should show details of user:

      window.cs142models.photoOfUserModel(userId):
      
      {JSON.stringify(window.cs142models.photoOfUserModel(this.props.match.params.userId))}
